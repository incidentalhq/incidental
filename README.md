## Quick start

This guide will help you set up Incidental for local development.

### Requirements:

- docker
- docker-compose
- pnpm
- node v18

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a new Slack application**

   - Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps, and use the `slack-manifest.yml` as a template to create the app.
   - Replace `BACKEND_BASE_URL` with the URL where you're hosting the backend
   - Replace `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` with the URL where you're hosting the frontend

2. **Set up environment variables**

   - Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and update the Slack-specific environment variables
   - Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`

3. **Start the backend**

   - In the `backend` directory, run:

     ```bash
     make run-dev
     ```

   - This will run the backend at http://localhost:5000

4. **Start the frontend**

   - In the `frontend` directory, run:

     ```bash
     make run-dev
     ```

   - This will run the frontend at http://localhost:3000

5. **Create a new account**
